Gaussian mixture model is used for clustering of texture feature vectors. Medical diagnosing described here consists of learning part and inference part. In learning part knowledge is accumulated from cases with known diagnosis, which involves mixture model parameters estimation for every diagnosis considered. Inference is done by calculating the mixture value and maximizing it over every diagnosis considered. EM algorithm is used for Gaussian mixture model parameters estimation. For every possible diagnosis, parameters of one mixture model have to be calculated. To demonstrate the method, we present the experiment with real data, diagnosing the common liver lesions using computed tomography (CT) images.",,Ludvík Tesař,['no_publication_date']

However, the recent advances on information-theoretic learning have revived the interest on these models. With this motivation, in this paper we revisit the classical statistical problem of data-driven bandwidth selection by cross-validation maximum likelihood for Gaussian kernels. We find a solution to the optimization problem under both the spherical and the general case where a full covariance matrix is considered for the kernel. The fixed-point algorithms proposed in this paper obtain the maximum likelihood bandwidth in few iterations, without performing an exhaustive bandwidth search, which is unfeasible in the multivariate case. The convergence of the methods proposed is proved. A set of classification experiments are performed to prove the usefulness of the obtained models in pattern recognition.",,Jose M.

In simple cases order parameters are physically intuitive and trivial to develop (e.g., ion-pair distance), however in most cases, order parameter development becomes a much more difficult endeavor (e.g., crystal structure identification).

These DyNNs bring in more efficient inferences and enable deploying DNNs on resource-constrained devices e.g., mobile devices. In this work, we study a new vulnerability about DyNNs: can adversaries manipulate the DyNNs efficiency to provide a false sense of efficiency? To answer this question, we design SlothBomb, an adversarial attack that injects efficiency backdoors in DyNNs. SlothBomb can poison just a minimal percentage of DyNNs training data to inject a backdoor trigger into DyNNs. In the inference time, SlothBomb can use the backdoor trigger to slow down DyNNs and abuse the computational resources of DyNNs - an availability threat analogous to the denial-of-service attacks. We evaluate SlothBomb on three DNN backbone architectures (based on VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNet56) on two popular datasets (CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet) We show that a SlothBomb reduces the efficacy of DyNNs on triggered input samples while keeping almost the same efficiency on clean samples.",,Mirazul Haque,['no_publication_date']

To measure these preferences and determine what factors influence them, we design an English test and a novel-word test that include a variety of linguistic cues (noun phrase quantity, resultative structure, contextual information, temporal units) that bias toward certain interpretations.

To achieve learning, we first greatly reduce the planning space by framing the problem as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem, in which the actions are a set of pre-computed plans, and the state is the position of the free kick on the field.

Using optimization techniques to find parametric approximations to these subspaces, our framework generalizes from sparse observations to find and correct for statistical incongruences between expected and observed behavior.

An example domain is a restaurant setting where a robot waiter should take care of an ongoing stream of tasks, namely serving a number of tables, including delivering food to the tables and checking on customers. An action that the robot should take next at any point of time typically depends on the duration of possible actions, the state of each table, and how these tables evolve over time, eg, the food becomes cold after a few time steps. As most of these domains are dynamic and tasks are frequently being added and removed, the robot typically needs to plan for a short h-step horizon to quickly decide on the next action and replans at each time step. A conventional approach to deal with this problem is to combine all the tasks' states and robot actions into one large model and to compute an h-step optimal policy for this combined model. For the problems that we are interested in, the number of tasks, eg, the number of tables in the restaurant domain, can be large making this planning approach computationally impractical. The observation that we make however is that in many domains the number of tasks that the robot can accomplish within h-steps is very limited.

Most existing work is primarly focused on the monoplex setting where we have access to a network with only a single type of connection between entities. However, in the multiplex setting, where there are multiple types of connections between entities, tasks such as link prediction have been shown to have stronger performance when information from other connection types is taken into account.

In this paper, we propose a flexible and robust watermarking mechanism for generative tabular data. Specifically, a data provider with knowledge of the downstream tasks can partition the feature space into pairs of $(key, value)$ columns. Within each pair, the data provider first uses elements in the $key$ column to generate a randomized set of ''green'' intervals, then encourages elements of the $value$ column to be in one of these ''green'' intervals.

Unlike existing methods that learn a single skill prior from a large and diverse dataset, our framework learns a library of different distinction skill priors (ie, behavior priors) from a collection of specialized datasets, and learns how to combine them to solve a new task. This formulation allows the algorithm to acquire a set of specialized skill priors that are more reusable for downstream tasks; however, it also brings up additional challenges of how to effectively combine these unstructured sets of skill priors to form a new prior for new tasks. Specifically, it requires the agent not only to identify which skill prior (s) to use but also how to combine them (either sequentially or concurrently) to form a new prior. To achieve this goal, ASPiRe includes Adaptive Weight Module (AWM) that learns to infer an adaptive weight assignment between different skill priors and uses them to guide policy learning for downstream tasks via weighted Kullback-Leibler divergences. Our experiments demonstrate that ASPiRe can significantly accelerate the learning of new downstream tasks in the presence of multiple priors and show improvement on competitive baselines.",,,['no_author_name']

Robot-assisted interventions are often based on structured tasks where the robot sequentially guides the child towards the task goal. Motivated by a need for personalization to accommodate a diverse set of children profiles, this paper investigates the effect of different robot action sequences in structured socially interactive tasks targeting attention skills in children with different ASD profiles. Based on an autism diagnostic tool, we devised a robotic prompting scheme on a NAO humanoid robot, aimed at eliciting goal behaviors from the child, and integrated it in a novel interactive storytelling scenario involving screens. We programmed the robot to operate in three different modes: diagnostic-inspired (Assess), personalized therapy-inspired (Therapy), and random (Explore).

Typical work in RAT is performed using remote controlled robots; a technique called Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ). The robot is usually controlled, unbeknownst to the patient, by a human operator. However, WoZ has been demonstrated to not be a sustainable technique in the long-term. Providing the robots with autonomy (while remaining under the supervision of the therapist) has the potential to lighten the therapists burden, not only in the therapeutic session itself but also in longer-term diagnostic tasks. Therefore, there is a need for exploring several degrees of autonomy in social robots used in therapy. Increasing the autonomy of robots might also bring about a new set of challenges. In particular, there will be a need to answer new ethical questions regarding the use of robots with a vulnerable population, as well as a need to ensure ethically-compliant robot behaviours.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel particle filtering over sets based approach to multi-object tracking and identification. We model the multi-object tracking problem as a hidden Markov model with states and observations represented as finite sets. We then develop motion and observation functions accordingly, and do the inference via particle filtering. The corresponding object identification problem is then formulated and solved by using the expectation-maximization method. The set formulation enables us to avoid directly performing observation-to-object association.

For the case of key information extraction (KIE), one of the most common VRDU tasks, past work has typically employed the template ""What is the value for the {key}?"". However, given the variety of questions encountered in the wild, simple and uniform templates are insufficient for creating robust models in research and industrial contexts.

To address this limitation, we propose a novel Markov Decision Process (MDP) type for learning decision tree policies: Iterative Bounding MDPs (IBMDPs). An IBMDP is constructed around a base MDP so each IBMDP policy is guaranteed to correspond to a decision tree policy for the base MDP when using a method-agnostic masking procedure. Because of this decision tree equivalence, any function approximator can be used during training, including a neural network, while yielding a decision tree policy for the base MDP. We present the required masking procedure as well as a modified value update step which allows IBMDPs to be solved using existing algorithms. We apply this procedure to produce IBMDP variants of recent reinforcement learning methods.

In many settings, training data may be used in multiple downstream applications by different users, which means it may be most effective to intervene on the training data itself. In this work, we present FairWASP, a novel pre-processing approach designed to reduce disparities in classification datasets without modifying the original data. FairWASP returns sample-level weights such that the reweighted dataset minimizes the Wasserstein distance to the original dataset while satisfying (an empirical version of) demographic parity, a popular fairness criterion. We show theoretically that integer weights are optimal, which means our method can be equivalently understood as duplicating or eliminating samples. FairWASP can therefore be used to construct datasets which can be fed into any classification method, not just methods which accept sample weights. Our work is based on reformulating the pre-processing task as a large-scale mixed-integer program (MIP), for which we propose a highly efficient algorithm based on the cutting plane method.

A classical centralized planning approach has to find a solution inside a search space that contains every possible combination of robots and goals. This leads to inefficient solutions that do not scale well. Multi-Agent Planning (MAP) provides a new way to solve this kind of tasks efficiently. Previous works on MAP have proposed to factorize the problem to decrease the planning effort ie dividing the goals among the agents (robots). However, these techniques do not scale when the number of agents and goals grow. Also, in most real world scenarios with big maps, goals might not be reached by every robot so it has a computational cost associated. In this paper we propose a combination of robotics and planning techniques to alleviate and boost the computation of the goal assignment process. We use Actuation Maps (AMs). Given a map, AMs can determine the regions each agent can actuate on. Thus, specific information can be extracted to know which goals can be tackled by each agent, as well as cheaply estimating the cost of using each agent to achieve every goal.

Application examples include but are not limited to city-scale passenger routing in mass transit systems, network traffic engineering and planning for large-scale autonomous vehicles.  Abstract Multi-agent path planning (MAPP) is increasingly being used to address resource allocation problems in highly dynamic, distributed environments that involve autonomous agents. Example domains include surveillance automation, traffic control and others. Most MAPP approaches assume hard collisions, e.g., agents cannot share resources, or co-exist at the same node or edge. This assumption unnecessarily restricts the solution space and does not apply to many real-world scenarios. To mitigate this limitation, this paper introduces a more general class of MAPP problems—MAPP in a soft-collision context. In soft-collision MAPP problems, agents can share resources or co-exist in the same location at the expense of reducing the quality of the solution. Hard constraints can still be modeled by imposing a very high cost for sharing. This paper motivates and defines the soft-collision MAPP problem, and generalizes the widely-used M* MAPP algorithm to support the concept of soft-collisions. Soft-collision M* (SC-M*) extends M* by changing the definition of a collision, so paths with collisions that have a quality penalty below a given threshold are acceptable.

Its efficiency however depends on the quality of heuristic function used. In fact, it has been shown that the correlation between the heuristic function and the true costto-goal significantly affects the efficiency of the search, when used with a large weight on the heuristics. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the problem of computing heuristics that explicitly aim to minimize the amount of search efforts in finding a feasible plan. The key observation we exploit is that while heuristics tries to guide the search along what looks like an optimal path towards the goal, there are other paths that are clearly sub-optimal yet are much easier to compute. For example, in motion planning domains like footstep-planning for humanoids, a heuristic that guides the search along a path away from obstacles is less likely to encounter local minima compared with the heuristics that guides the search along an optimal but close-to-obstacles path. We utilize this observation to define the concept of conservative heuristics and propose a simple algorithm for computing such a heuristic function.

We demonstrated LETS-C not only outperforms the current SOTA in classification accuracy but also offers a lightweight solution, using only 14.5% of the trainable parameters on average compared to the SOTA model.

Different techniques have been proposed to determine which features (eg, image pixels) are most important for a CNN’s classification. However, the important features output by these techniques have typically been judged subjectively by a human to assess whether the important features capture the features relevant to the classification and not whether the features were actually important to classifier itself. We address the need for an objective measure to assess the quality of different feature importance measures. In particular, we propose measuring the ratio of a CNN’s accuracy on the whole image compared to an image containing only the important features. We also consider scaling this ratio by the relative size of the important region in order to measure the conciseness. We demonstrate that our measures correlate well with prior subjective comparisons of important features, but importantly do not require their human studies. We also demonstrate that the features on which multiple techniques agree are important have a higher impact on accuracy than those features that only one technique finds.",,,['no_author_name']

Additionally, we propose a method to generate these Abstracted Policy Graphs for deterministic policies given a learned value function and a set of observed transitions, potentially off-policy transitions used during training.

Parameter sharing with decentralized execution has been introduced as an efficient way to train multiple agents using a single policy network. However, the nature of resulting equilibria reached by such agents has not been yet studied: we introduce the novel concept of Shared equilibrium as a symmetric pure Nash equilibrium of a certain Functional Form Game (FFG) and prove convergence to the latter for a certain class of games using self-play. In addition, it is important that such equilibria satisfy certain constraints so that MAS are calibrated to real world data for practical use: we solve this problem by introducing a novel dual-Reinforcement Learning based approach that fits emergent behaviors of agents in a Shared equilibrium to externally-specified targets, and apply our methods to a n-player market example.

Most of the existing work focuses primarily on the monoplex setting where we have access to a network with only a single type of connection between entities. However, in the multiplex setting, where there are multiple types of connections, or \emph{layers}, between entities, performance on tasks such as link prediction has been shown to be stronger when information from other connection types is taken into account. We propose an algorithm for scalable learning on multiplex networks with a large number of layers. The efficiency of our method is enabled by an online learning algorithm that learns how to sample relevant neighboring layers so that only the layers with relevant information are aggregated during training. This sampling differs from prior work, such as MNE, which aggregates information across \emph{all} layers and consequently leads to computational intractability on large networks.

Although deep learning techniques have shown great potential in the field of bearing fault diagnosis, the effectiveness of these methods often depends on a large number of high-quality fault samples, which are often difficult to obtain in practical applications. To address this challenge, this study proposes an adaptive sampling Multi-scale Time Series Diffusion Model (MTSDM) to solve the problem of sample imbalance in bearing fault diagnosis. The MTSDM uses a Nested U-Net structure, which enhances the learning and recognition ability of vibration signals through adaptive convolution kernels and multi-layer stacking design at different depths and widths for multi-scale feature extraction. To verify the performance of the MTSDM model, we first conducted experiments on artificially constructed small-sample simple time-series datasets to verify the effectiveness of the model in generating time-series signals. Subsequently, further experiments were conducted on two actual bearing fault datasets to evaluate the performance of the model using real-world data. The experimental results show that the MTSDM can effectively generate vibration signals with real characteristics, significantly improving the fault diagnosis accuracy under small-sample conditions. In particular when the number of samples is extremely limited (for example, only five samples per fault type), the diagnostic accuracy of the MTSDM model is significantly improved compared with existing methods.",,Feiyu Lu,['no_publication_date']

Adversarial training, which imitates the adversary during the training stage, has thus emerged as the *de facto* standard for hedging against adversarial attacks. Although adversarial training provides some robustness over ERM, it can still be subject to overfitting, which explains why recent work mixing the training set with synthetic data obtains improved out-of-sample performances. Inspired by these observations, we develop a Wasserstein distributionally robust (DR) counterpart of adversarial training for improved generalization and provide a recipe for further reducing the conservatism of this approach by adjusting its ambiguity set with respect to synthetic data. The underlying optimization problem, DR adversarial training with synthetic data, is nonconvex and comprises infinitely many constraints. To this end, by using results from robust optimization and convex analysis, we develop tractable relaxations.

Due to the complexities of deploying these models, LLM evaluation is often outsourced to a third-party cloud, which leaks the clients' queries to this external provider. These queries could contain sensitive information such as intellectual property, medical information, and proprietary data. Protecting this data while maintaining the LLM's functionality is a major privacy challenge.     Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) presents a natural solution to this problem: simply encrypt the query and evaluate the LLM homomorphically on the cloud machine. The result remains encrypted and can only be learned by the client who holds the secret key. There are two barriers to this solution: (1) FHE operations do not easily support the LLM activation functions and (2) FHE implementations remain too slow to evaluate an LLM in a reasonable time.

Mismatch may be conservative in sparse data regions and less so otherwise, which can result in under-performing their no-penalty variants in practice. We derive a new pessimistic penalty as the distance between the data and the true distribution using an evaluable one-sample test known as Stein Discrepancy that requires minimal smoothness conditions, and noticeably, allows a mixture family representation of distribution over next states. This entity forms a quantifier of information in offline data, which justifies calling this approach \emph{information-directed pessimism} (IDP) for offline RL.

Learning in such a fixed reward paradigm in RL can neglect important policy optimization considerations, such as state space coverage and safety. Moreover, it can fail to encompass broader impacts in terms of social welfare, sustainability, or market stability, potentially leading to undesirable emergent behavior and potentially misaligned policy. To mathematically encapsulate the problem of aligning RL policy optimization with such externalities, we consider a bilevel optimization problem and connect it to a principal-agent framework, where the principal specifies the broader goals and constraints of the system at the upper level and the agent solves a Markov Decision Process (MDP) at the lower level. The upper-level deals with learning a suitable reward parametrization corresponding to the broader goals and the lower-level deals with learning the policy for the agent. We propose Principal driven Policy Alignment via Bilevel RL (PPA-BRL), which efficiently aligns the policy of the agent with the principal's goals. We explicitly analyzed the dependence of the principal's trajectory on the lower-level policy, and prove the convergence of PPA-BRL to the stationary point of the problem.

To address this limitation, we consider the Multi-level Actor-Critic (MAC) framework, which incorporates a Multi-level Monte-Carlo (MLMC) gradient estimator. With our approach, we effectively alleviate the dependency on mixing time knowledge, a first for average-reward MDPs global convergence. Furthermore, our approach exhibits the tightest available dependence of  known from prior work. With a 2D grid world goal-reaching navigation experiment, we demonstrate that MAC outperforms the existing state-of-the-art policy gradient-based method for average reward settings.",,Alec Koppel,['no_publication_date']

In-context learning has recently emerged as a promising approach for leveraging pretrained knowledge of LLMs across a range of natural language processing tasks and has been widely adopted in both academia and industry. However, how to utilize in-context learning for effective KGC remains relatively underexplored.  We develop a novel method that incorporates topological information through in-context learning to enhance KGC performance.

Mismatch may be conservative in sparse data regions and less so otherwise, which can result in under-performing their no-penalty variants in practice. We derive a new pessimistic penalty as the distance between the data and the true distribution using an evaluable one-sample test known as Stein Discrepancy that requires minimal smoothness conditions, and noticeably, allows a mixture family representation of distribution over next states. This entity forms a quantifier of information in offline data, which justifies calling this approach \emph{information-directed pessimism} (IDP) for offline RL.

However, they often make overconfident, incorrect predictions or ""hallucinations"", which can be risky in high-stakes settings like healthcare, and finance. To improve safety, we leverage conformal prediction (CP), a model-agnostic framework that provides distribution-free uncertainty quantification. CP transforms a score function, which measures how well an output ``conforms"" to a given input, into prediction sets that contain the true answer with high probability. While CP ensures this coverage guarantee for arbitrary scores, the quality of the scores significantly impacts the size of prediction sets. Prior works have relied on LLM logits or other heuristic scores, lacking guarantees on their quality. To address this issue,  we propose an optimization framework (CP-OPT) to learn scores that minimize set sizes while maintaining coverage guarantees. Furthermore, leveraging the coverage guarantees of CP, we propose a conformal revision of questions (CROQs) to revise the problem by narrowing down the available choices to those in the prediction set. Our results on MMLU and ToolAlpaca datasets with Llama3 and Phi-3 models show that optimized CP scores reduce the set sizes by up to 13\% and CROQs improves accuracy relatively by up to  overall and up to  in non-trivial parts of the input space.",,Sumitra Ganesh,['no_publication_date']

Existing sparse training methods usually strive to find the best sparse subnetwork possible in one single run, without involving any expensive dense or pre-training steps. For instance, dynamic sparse training (DST), as one of the most prominent directions, is capable of reaching a competitive performance of dense training by iteratively evolving the sparse topology during the course of training. In this paper, we argue that it is better to allocate the limited resources to create multiple low-loss sparse subnetworks and superpose them into a stronger one, instead of allocating all resources entirely to find an individual subnetwork. To achieve this, two desiderata are required:(1) efficiently producing many low-loss subnetworks, the so-called cheap tickets, within one training process limited to the standard training time used in dense training;(2) effectively superposing these cheap tickets into one stronger subnetwork without going over the constrained parameter budget.

Across existing defense techniques, adversarial training with the projected gradient decent attack (adv.PGD) is considered as one of the most effective ways to achieve moderate adversarial robustness. However, adv.PGD requires too much training time since the projected gradient attack (PGD) takes multiple iterations to generate perturbations. On the other hand, adversarial training with the fast gradient sign method (adv.FGSM) takes much less training time since the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) takes one step to generate perturbations but fails to increase adversarial robustness. In this work, we extend adv.FGSM to make it achieve the adversarial robustness of adv.PGD. We demonstrate that the large curvature along FGSM perturbed direction leads to a large difference in performance of adversarial robustness between adv.FGSM and adv.PGD, and therefore propose combining adv.FGSM with a curvature regularization (adv.FGSMR) in order to bridge the performance gap between adv.FGSM and adv.PGD. The experiments show that adv.FGSMR has higher training efficiency than adv.PGD.

In this paper, we present DocLLM, a lightweight extension to traditional large language models (LLMs) for reasoning over visual documents, taking into account both textual semantics and spatial layout. Our model differs from existing multimodal LLMs by avoiding expensive image encoders and focuses exclusively on bounding box information to incorporate the spatial layout structure. Specifically, the cross-alignment between text and spatial modalities is captured by decomposing the attention mechanism in classical transformers to a set of disentangled matrices. Furthermore, we devise a pre-training objective that learns to infill text segments. This approach allows us to address irregular layouts and heterogeneous content frequently encountered in visual documents. The pre-trained model is fine-tuned using a large-scale instruction dataset, covering four core document intelligence tasks.

In particular, despite an increased number of curative resections, many postoperative patients still develop recurrent lesions. Consequently, there is a significant need for prognostic tools that can more accurately predict a patient's risk for recurrence. In this paper, we explore the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the segmentation and recurrence risk prediction of lung tumors that are present in preoperative computed tomography (CT) images. First, expanding upon recent progress in medical image segmentation, a residual U-Net is used to localize and characterize each nodule.

With the booming of customers’ reviews online, an efficient sentiment analysis algorithm will substantially enhance a review recommendation system’s performance, providing users with more helpful and informative reviews. Recently, two kinds of LDA derived models, namely Word Model and Phrase Model, take the dominant positions in this field. However, the requirement of exact aspect number underlies the usability and flexibility of these LDA extended models. Although, Dirichlet Process (DP), which can help to automatically generate the number of aspects, has been on trial, its random word assignment mechanism makes the result unsatisfying. This paper proposes a model named Similarity Dependency Dirichlet Process (SDDP) to cope with the above problems. SDDP inherits the merits of DP to automatically determine the number of aspects, but it exploits the semantic similarities between words to infer aspects and sentiments, alleviating the random assignment problem in DP. Furthermore, based on SDDP, this paper builds a word model W-SDDP and a phrase model P-SDDP respectively to detect aspects and sentiments from two different perspectives.

DetectorDetective enables users to easily learn about how the three key modules of the Faster R-CNN object detector--Feature Pyramidal Network, Region Proposal Network, and Region Of Interest Head--respond to a user-selected benign image and its adversarial version. Visualizations about the progressive changes in the intermediate features among such modules help users gain insights into the impact of adversarial attacks, and perform side-by-side comparisons between the benign and adversarial responses. Furthermore, DetectorDetective displays saliency maps for the input images to comparatively highlight image regions that contribute to attack success. DetectorDetective complements adversarial machine learning research on object detection by providing a user-friendly interactive tool for inspecting and understanding model responses.

Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) are the more common form of this planning. HTN planning decomposes tasks (ie, names) into subtasks (which are also names), which eventually decompose into actions. Because HTNs decompose task names, they are not strictly required to relate to the actual state of the world. For example, a cooking recipe describing how to prepare a dish does not necessarily list the required ingredients (they could be inferred) and may not relate the ingredients within a specific kitchen. In contrast, Hierarchical Goal Networks (HGNs), purposely relate the decomposition methods to the world states–the goals–a system needs to complete (Shivashankar 2015). For example, the methods of an HGN would probably state that, for each ingredient, one must achieve the subgoal (ie, the precondition) have (ingredient) before starting the recipe.

Flutes uses structural subtyping so that two types defined independently can be related if they have a common structure. In addition, Flutes provides a solution to the problem of ensuring that objects are translated from one UIMA type system to semantically related objects in another UIMA type system.

My recent works have been on pushing the boundaries of sublinear time or sublinear query algorithms in the context of matrices and their applications. Matrices are ubiquitous mathematical structures in both computer science and, in particular, machine learning, and are often used to represent data and parameters of learning models. As such, very large datasets and complex learning models have led to a requirement for efficient computational algorithms.

The variations can arise in both task-irrelevant features, such as background noise, and task-relevant features, such as robot configurations, that are related to the optimal decisions. To achieve generalization in both situations, agents are required to accurately understand the impact of changed features on the decisions, ie, establishing the true associations between changed features and decisions in the policy model. However, due to the inherent correlations among features in the state space, the associations between features and decisions become entangled, making it difficult for the policy to distinguish them. To this end, we propose Saliency-Guided Features Decorrelation (SGFD) to eliminate these correlations through sample reweighting. Concretely, SGFD consists of two core techniques: Random Fourier Functions (RFF) and the saliency map. RFF is utilized to estimate the complex non-linear correlations in high-dimensional images, while the saliency map is designed to identify the changed features. Under the guidance of the saliency map, SGFD employs sample reweighting to minimize the estimated correlations related to changed features, thereby achieving decorrelation in visual RL tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that SGFD can generalize well on a wide range of test environments and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in handling both task-irrelevant variations and task-relevant variations.",,,['no_author_name']

It has been shown that when ignoring the long-term effect, naively imposing fairness criterion in static settings can actually exacerbate bias over time. To explicitly address biases in sequential decision-making, recent works formulate long-term fairness notions in Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework. They define the long-term bias to be the sum of static bias over each time step. However, we demonstrate that naively summing up the step-wise bias can cause a false sense of fairness since it fails to consider the importance difference of different time steps during transition. In this work, we introduce a long-term fairness notion called Equal Long-term Benefit Rate (ELBERT), which explicitly considers varying temporal importance and adapts static fairness principles to the sequential setting. Moreover, we show that the policy gradient of Long-term Benefit Rate can be analytically reduced to standard policy gradient. This makes standard policy optimization methods applicable for reducing the bias, leading to our proposed bias mitigation method ELBERT-PO. Experiments on three sequential decision making environments show that ELBERT-PO significantly reduces bias and maintains high utility.

Recent works on automatic data augmentation learn a policy to form a sequence of augmentation operations, which are still pre-defined and restricted to limited options. In this paper, we show that a prior-free autonomous data augmentation's objective can be derived from a representation learning principle that aims to preserve the minimum sufficient information of the labels. Given an example, the objective aims at creating a distant``hard positive example''as the augmentation, while still preserving the original label.

In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) imitates the natural learning process of humans and can give birth to intelligent agents for automatic (sequential) decision making. By learning from interactions and maximizing long-term utilities, RL agents are shown to achieve superhuman performance in many scenarios such as video games and board games [6, 8, 7]. However, the success of these learning-based intelligent agents is mainly evaluated in stable and stationary simulated environments, while there are still many challenges impeding the application of these intelligent agents in real-world scenarios.Why is the real world challenging? We live in the era of information explosion, while noisy, false or even adversarial information is mixed with useful information needed for making decisions. Recent work has revealed that a well-trained agent could greatly fail when the input is slightly but adversarially perturbed [3, 2].

In this paper, we take one step forward to investigate controllable generation with temporal conditions that are refined from temporal information. We observe the importance of temporal conditions in sequential generation in sufficient explorative scenarios and provide a comprehensive discussion and comparison of different temporal conditions. Based on the observations, we propose an effective temporally-conditional diffusion model coined Temporally-Composable Diffuser (TCD), which extracts temporal information from interaction sequences and explicitly guides generation with temporal conditions.

Each condition preserves non-overlapping temporal information of sequences, enabling more controllable generation when we jointly use them to guide the diffuser.

Using tensor analysis, we propose a series of intuitive, data-dependent and easily-measurable properties that tightly characterize the compressibility and generalizability of neural networks; thus, in practice, our generalization bound outperforms the previous compression-based ones, especially for neural networks using tensors as their weight kernels (eg CNNs). Moreover, these intuitive measurements provide further insights into designing neural network architectures with properties favorable for better/guaranteed generalizability. Our experimental results demonstrate that through the proposed measurable properties, our generalization error bound matches the trend of the test error well.

However, finding the optimal adversary is challenging, in terms of both whether we can find the optimal attack and how efficiently we can find it. Existing works on adversarial RL either use heuristics-based methods that may not find the strongest adversary, or directly train an RL-based adversary by treating the agent as a part of the environment, which can find the optimal adversary but may become intractable in a large state space. This paper introduces a novel attacking method to find the optimal attacks through collaboration between a designed function named ""actor"" and an RL-based learner named ""director"". The actor crafts state perturbations for a given policy perturbation direction, and the director learns to propose the best policy perturbation directions. Our proposed algorithm, PA-AD, is theoretically optimal and significantly more efficient than prior RL-based works in environments with large state spaces. Empirical results show that our proposed PA-AD universally outperforms state-of-the-art attacking methods in various Atari and MuJoCo environments.

Previous models do not account for the possibility that the attacker may only have partial control over  or that the attack may produce easily detectable ""abnormal"" behaviors. Furthermore, there is a lack of provably efficient defenses against these adversarial policies. To address these limitations, we introduce a generalized attack framework that has the flexibility to model to what extent the adversary is able to control the agent, and allows the attacker to regulate the state distribution shift and produce stealthier adversarial policies. Moreover, we offer a provably efficient defense with polynomial convergence to the most robust victim policy through adversarial training with timescale separation. This stands in sharp contrast to supervised learning, where adversarial training typically provides only \textit{empirical} defenses. Using the Robosumo competition experiments, we show that our generalized attack formulation results in much stealthier adversarial policies when maintaining the same winning rate as baselines.

Due to mental and physical workloads, automation technologies have been applied to formation flight for precise station-keeping and resultant fuel reduction, shifting control authority from humans to machines. Accordingly, the human is not directly in the control loop, but just supervises whether or not the automation works as intended. One critical problem in AFF supervisory control is that the human pilot needs to intervene with AFF system when the automated systems malfunction or their functions degrade. Thus while monitoring a station-keeping display, operators should minimize incorrect decisions for safety and cost reduction. To examine design issues in such a display, a simulation was constructed that simulated two different control systems as well as the impact of different angles of bank. 20 subjects participated in the monitoring task simulation of the station-keeping display. During the experiments, subjects were asked to intervene with AFF system when the AFF system failed to keep the trailing aircraft in the vortex area. Subjects made the most incorrect decisions when the AFF system was operated with the oscillating controller and high angle of bank.",,,['no_author_name']

In this work, we focus on detecting OOD inputs in a partial inference setting and investigate whether the skipping mechanism used in dynamic neural networks (DyNNs) can be leveraged for early OOD detection. We first establish that the feature maps at various DyNN gates can help identify anomalies. Building on this, we propose SkipOOD, a lightweight OOD detector that uses an uncertainty scoring function and an exit detector at each gate to robustly identify OODs as early as possible.

IABS methods provide an artificial market for the experimental strategy using a population of background trading agents.

The concept labels, or rationales as we refer to them, are learned by the concept labeling component of the CBM. Another component learns to predict the target classification label from these predicted concept labels. Unfortunately, these models are heavily reliant on human provided concept labels for each datapoint. To enable CBMs to behave robustly when these labels are not readily available, we show how to equip them with the ability to abstain from predicting concepts when the concept labeling component is uncertain.

Due to the complexities of deploying these models, LLM evaluation is often outsourced to a third-party cloud, which leaks the clients' queries to this external provider. These queries could contain sensitive information such as intellectual property, medical information, and proprietary data. Protecting this data while maintaining the LLM's functionality is a major privacy challenge.     Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) presents a natural solution to this problem: simply encrypt the query and evaluate the LLM homomorphically on the cloud machine. The result remains encrypted and can only be learned by the client who holds the secret key. There are two barriers to this solution: (1) FHE operations do not easily support the LLM activation functions and (2) FHE implementations remain too slow to evaluate an LLM in a reasonable time.

However, they often make overconfident, incorrect predictions or ""hallucinations"", which can be risky in high-stakes settings like healthcare, and finance. To improve safety, we leverage conformal prediction (CP), a model-agnostic framework that provides distribution-free uncertainty quantification. CP transforms a score function, which measures how well an output ``conforms"" to a given input, into prediction sets that contain the true answer with high probability. While CP ensures this coverage guarantee for arbitrary scores, the quality of the scores significantly impacts the size of prediction sets. Prior works have relied on LLM logits or other heuristic scores, lacking guarantees on their quality. To address this issue,  we propose an optimization framework (CP-OPT) to learn scores that minimize set sizes while maintaining coverage guarantees. Furthermore, leveraging the coverage guarantees of CP, we propose a conformal revision of questions (CROQs) to revise the problem by narrowing down the available choices to those in the prediction set. Our results on MMLU and ToolAlpaca datasets with Llama3 and Phi-3 models show that optimized CP scores reduce the set sizes by up to 13\% and CROQs improves accuracy relatively by up to  overall and up to  in non-trivial parts of the input space.",,Alan Mishler,['no_publication_date']

Yet, smaller models have benefits of energy efficiency and are often easier to interpret. To simultaneously get the benefits of large and small models we often encourage sparsity in the model weights of large models. For this, different approaches have been proposed including weight-pruning and distillation. Unfortunately, most existing approaches do not have a controllable way to request a desired value of sparsity as an interpretable parameter and get it right in a single run. In this work, we design a new sparse projection method for a set of weights in order to achieve a desired average level of sparsity without additional hyperparameter tuning which is measured using the ratio of the l1 and l2 norms. Instead of projecting each vector of the weight matrix individually, or using sparsity as a regularizer, we project all vectors together to achieve an average target sparsity, where the sparsity levels of the individual vectors of the weight matrix are automatically tuned. Our projection operator has the following guarantees–(A) it is fast and enjoys a runtime linear in the size of the vectors;(B) the solution is unique except for a measure set of zero. We utilize our projection operator to obtain the desired sparsity of deep learning models in a single run with a negligible performance hit, while competing methods require sparsity hyperparameter tuning.

We partition random variables into coregulated clusters focusing on arbitrary multivariate relations and ignoring their detailed structure. Multivariate interactions among groups of random variables are hard to compute and even the best estimators are not very fast. To address this, we show that the problem can be cast in the form suitable to the recently proposed framework for smooth function approximation over a hypercube.

Adversarial training, which imitates the adversary during the training stage, has thus emerged as the *de facto* standard for hedging against adversarial attacks. Although adversarial training provides some robustness over ERM, it can still be subject to overfitting, which explains why recent work mixing the training set with synthetic data obtains improved out-of-sample performances. Inspired by these observations, we develop a Wasserstein distributionally robust (DR) counterpart of adversarial training for improved generalization and provide a recipe for further reducing the conservatism of this approach by adjusting its ambiguity set with respect to synthetic data. The underlying optimization problem, DR adversarial training with synthetic data, is nonconvex and comprises infinitely many constraints. To this end, by using results from robust optimization and convex analysis, we develop tractable relaxations.

For systematic evaluations, we collected a dataset that includes 561 execution-time situations in a dining domain, where each situation corresponds to a state instance of a robot being potentially unable to complete a task using a solution that normally works. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms competitive baselines from the literature in the success rate of service tasks. Additionally, we have demonstrated COWP using a mobile manipulator. Supplementary materials are available at: https://cowplanning.github.io/",,,['no_author_name']

We study the dynamics of the algorithm and investigate how varying different hyperparameters impacts the performance of the clustering algorithm for different random initialisations. We compute simple metrics that we find are useful in identifying high-quality clusterings. Then, we extend the technique of Wasserstein k-means clustering to multidimensional time series data by approximating the multidimensional Wasserstein distance as a sliced Wasserstein distance, resulting in a method we call `sliced Wasserstein k-means (sWk-means) clustering'. We apply the sWk-means clustering method to the problem of automated regime detection in multidimensional time series data, using synthetic data to demonstrate the validity of the approach. Finally, we show that the sWk-means method is effective in identifying distinct market regimes in real multidimensional financial time series, using publicly available foreign exchange spot rate data as a case study.

AI technology has developed rapidly over the past two decades in many fields, often in ways that can easily be adapted to aquaculture production. Two advances that have particular impacts are deep learning and convolutional neural networks. Traditional machine learning uses algorithms to perform functions with the data being supplied, but in a way that becomes more efficient over time through feedback and adjustments (partially from human input). At the same time, sensor technology has advanced by leaps and bounds, as have connectivity options through the Cloud, 5G networks and the internet of things (IoT).

In our experiments this method is applied to graphs containing up to tens of thousands of nodes. The execution time scales linearly with the number of nodes, and the method is highly parallelizable.

Major challenges of computational methods for drug response prediction are that labeled clinical data is very limited, not publicly available, or has drug response for one or two drugs. These challenges have been addressed by generating large-scale pre-clinical datasets such as cancer cell lines or patient-derived xenografts (PDX). These pre-clinical datasets have multi-omics characterization of samples and are often screened with hundreds of drugs which makes them viable resources for precision oncology. However, they raise new questions: how can we integrate different data types? how can we handle data discrepancy between pre-clinical and clinical datasets that exist due to basic biological differences? and how can we make the best use of unlabeled samples in drug response prediction where labeling is extra challenging? In this thesis, we propose methods based on deep neural networks to answer these questions. First, we propose a method of multi-omics integration. Second, we propose a transfer learning method to address data discrepancy between cell lines, patients, and PDX models in the input and output space. Finally, we proposed a semi-supervised method of out-of-distribution generalization to predict drug response using labeled and unlabeled samples.

Recent research has also explored the integration of reinforcement learning (RL) into these models, in addition to generating superior user representations. By framing sequential recommendation as an RL problem with reward signals, we can develop recommender systems that incorporate direct user feedback in the form of rewards, enhancing personalization for users.  Nonetheless, employing RL algorithms presents challenges, including off-policy training, expansive combinatorial action spaces, and the scarcity of datasets with sufficient reward signals. Contemporary approaches have attempted to combine RL and sequential modeling, incorporating contrastive-based objectives and negative sampling strategies for training the RL component.  In this work, we further emphasize the efficacy of contrastive-based objectives paired with augmentation to address datasets with extended horizons. Additionally, we recognize the potential instability issues that may arise during the application of negative sampling. These challenges primarily stem from the data imbalance prevalent in real-world datasets, which is a common issue in offline RL contexts.

This negatively impacts the training of deep neural networks (DNNs) by increasing runtime and/or decreasing accuracy when reducing model and/or batch size to fit this capacity. Lossy compression is a promising approach to tackling memory capacity constraints, but prior approaches rely on hyperparameter search to achieve a suitable trade-off between convergence and compression, negating runtime benefits. In this paper we build upon recent developments on Stochastic Gradient Descent convergence to prove an upper bound on the expected loss increase when training with compressed activation storage. We then express activation compression error in terms of this bound, allowing the compression rate to adapt to training conditions automatically. The advantage of our approach, called AC-GC, over existing lossy compression frameworks is that, given a preset allowable increase in loss, significant compression without significant increase in error can be achieved with a single training run. When combined with error-bounded methods, AC-GC achieves 15.1 x compression with an average accuracy change of 0.1% on text and image datasets.

Neural network workloads can generally be separated into the preparation (training) and usage (inference) of the network. The training of deep neural networks is especially hampered by memory limitations, as increasing model size (and thus memory) is a common technique to improve accuracy. Previous approaches have examined lossy compression and offloading to reduce activation memory consumption, the primary memory consumer for most models. However, prior works use techniques without utilizing the spatial properties of many neural networks. As well, there is no known relationship between the trained accuracy of a network, and the compression rate, leading to expensive searches for compression rates. In this dissertation, we begin by examining lossy spatial compression using JPEG for ACTivations (JPEG-ACT). JPEG-ACT uses custom-tuned error sensitivities to target machine perception and a hardware accelerator to offload compressed activation values during training. Using the JPEG-ACT accelerator results in an 8.5 x memory reduction over uncompressed training and 2.3 x performance versus the next-best offload accelerator. Following this, we examine the theoretical relationship between compression errors and accuracy. Prior approaches used expensive tuning to determine the compression/accuracy trade-off after training.

They create constraints on Deep Neural Networks to represent the minority labels and avoid bias towards majority labels. The extensive body of imbalanced approaches address categorical label spaces but fail to effectively extend to regression problems where the label space is continuous. Conversely, local and global correlations among continuous labels provide valuable insights towards effectively modelling relationships in feature space. In this work, we propose ConR, a contrastive regularizer that models global and local label similarities in feature space and prevents the features of minority samples from being collapsed into their majority neighbours. Serving the similarities of the predictions as an indicator of feature similarities, ConR discerns the dissagreements between the label space and feature space and imposes a penalty on these disagreements. ConR minds the continuous nature of label space with two main strategies in a contrastive manner: incorrect proximities are penalized proportionate to the label similarities and the correct ones are encouraged to model local similarities.

Our method is based on a Bayesian dynamic model that can adapt to conditional distribution changes and a deep conditional distribution model that can handle large multivariate time series using a factorized output space.

Our novel unsupervised outlier detection framework is based on ideas from generative adversarial networks (GANs) and reinforcement learning (RL). We train a 'generator' that corrects outliers in the data with a 'discriminator' that learns to discriminate the corrected data from the real data, which may contain outliers. A key insight is that if the generator made a mistake in the correction, it would generate anomalies that are different from the anomalies in the real data, so it serves as data augmentation for the discriminator learning.

The choice of task head plays an important role in fine-tuning, as the pretrained and downstream tasks are usually different. Although there exist many different designs for finetuning, a full understanding of when and why these algorithms work has been elusive. We analyze how the choice of task head controls feature adaptation and hence influences the downstream performance. By decomposing the learning dynamics of adaptation, we find that the key aspect is the training accuracy and loss at the beginning of finetuning, which determines the ""energy"" available for the feature's adaptation. We identify a significant trend in the effect of changes in this initial energy on the resulting features after fine-tuning. Specifically, as the energy increases, the Euclidean and cosine distances between the resulting and original features increase, while their dot products (and the resulting features' norm) first increase and then decrease. Inspired by this, we give several practical principles that lead to better downstream performance. We analytically prove this trend in an overparamterized linear setting and verify its applicability to different experimental settings.",,,['no_author_name']

For all three cases, the value of k plays a major role in model performance. The FP generator is the least sensitive because, in FP, k only affects the initialization of the adjacency matrix but then the model can change the number of neighbors of each node. For MLP and MLP-D, however, the number of neighbors of each node remains close to k (but not necessarily equal as the adjacency processor can add or remove some edges) and the two generators become more sensitive to k. For larger values of k, the extra flexibility of the MLP generator enables removing some of the unwanted edges through the function P or reducing the weights of the unwanted edges resulting in MLP being less sensitive to large values of k compared to MLP-D.Increasing the number of layers: In the main text, we described how some edges may receive no supervision during latent graph learning.

From this interpretation, we develop a theoretical framework on stability and reversibility of deep neural networks, and derive three reversible neural network architectures that can go arbitrarily deep in theory. The reversibility property allows a memory-efficient implementation, which does not need to store the activations for most hidden layers. Together with the stability of our architectures, this enables training deeper networks using only modest computational resources. We provide both theoretical analyses and empirical results. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our architectures against several strong baselines on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and STL-10 with superior or on-par state-of-the-art performance.

They create constraints on Deep Neural Networks to represent the minority labels and avoid bias towards majority labels. The extensive body of imbalanced approaches address categorical label spaces but fail to effectively extend to regression problems where the label space is continuous. Conversely, local and global correlations among continuous labels provide valuable insights towards effectively modelling relationships in feature space. In this work, we propose ConR, a contrastive regularizer that models global and local label similarities in feature space and prevents the features of minority samples from being collapsed into their majority neighbours. Serving the similarities of the predictions as an indicator of feature similarities, ConR discerns the dissagreements between the label space and feature space and imposes a penalty on these disagreements. ConR minds the continuous nature of label space with two main strategies in a contrastive manner: incorrect proximities are penalized proportionate to the label similarities and the correct ones are encouraged to model local similarities. ConR consolidates essential considerations into a generic, easy-to-integrate, and efficient method that effectively addresses deep imbalanced regression. Moreover, ConR is orthogonal to existing approaches and smoothly extends to uni- and multi-dimensional label spaces. Our comprehensive experiments show that ConR significantly boosts the performance of all the state-of-the-art methods on three large-scale deep imbalanced regression benchmarks.

By leveraging the inherent benefits of self-supervision, SSCL enables the pre-training of representation models using vast amounts of unlabeled data. Despite these advances, there remains a significant gap in understanding the impact of different SSCL strategies on time series forecasting performance, as well as the specific benefits that SSCL can bring. This paper aims to address these gaps by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of various training variables, including different SSCL algorithms, learning strategies, model architectures, and their interplay. Additionally, to gain deeper insights into the improvements brought about by SSCL in the context of time-series forecasting, a qualitative analysis of the empirical receptive field is performed. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that the end-to-end training of a Transformer model using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and SSCL emerges as the most effective approach in time series forecasting. Notably, the incorporation of the contrastive objective enables the model to prioritize more pertinent information for forecasting, such as scale and periodic relationships.

In this study, a deep neural network is proposed, specifically a residual network (ResNet) using dilated convolution, batch normalization, and rectified linear unit (ReLU) layers with fused spatial- and channel-attention modules to enhance the quality of LDCT images.

In fact, learning new skills by imitation is faster, safer, and more efficient. Similarly, in robotics and artificial intelligence, due to much amount of conveniences that imitation learning offers to robot programming, it is now a core topic of research in the field. This work presents a survey in imitation learning with more emphasis on robot programming and control. It has been tried to refer to different aspects of the topic even though in a few words, so the readers get familiar with almost all the issues, but the details might be followed in the references.

Especially with the rising success of complex black-box ML models such as deep neural networks, explainability is considered a fundamental and complementary ingredient of practical AI development to address issues such as safety, fairness, and trustworthiness. This can be especially important in critical applications such as healthcare, finance, and social studies.Machine Learning explainability can be categorized into two main paradigms: model explanation (aka global explanation) and outcome/prediction explanation (aka local explanation). Global explanation aims to decode the model as a whole and explain the overall logic behind it. In contrast, local explanation aims to explain the predictions for individual instances. In both paradigms, explanations can be presented in a variety of forms, such as rules, additive terms, feature importance, prototypes, exemplars, counterfactuals, expected response plots and other types of visualizations [4].",,Hossein Hajimirsadeghi,['no_publication_date']

Multi-label classification is a more difficult task than single-label classification because both the input images and output label spaces are more complex. Furthermore, collecting clean multi-label annotations is more difficult to scale-up than single-label annotations. To reduce the annotation cost, we propose to train a model with partial labels ie only some labels are known per image. We first empirically compare different labeling strategies to show the potential for using partial labels on multi-label datasets. Then to learn with partial labels, we introduce a new classification loss that exploits the proportion of known labels per example. Our approach allows the use of the same training settings as when learning with all the annotations. We further explore several curriculum learning based strategies to predict missing labels.

Current state-of-the-art methods in this area are fully supervised, but for many real-world problems it is hardly possible to obtain enough labeled samples. In this paper, we propose the first method of domain generalization to leverage unlabeled samples, combining of meta learning's episodic training and semi-supervised learning, called DGSML. DGSML employs an entropy-based pseudo-labeling approach to assign labels to unlabeled samples and then utilizes a novel discrepancy loss to ensure that class centroids before and after labeling unlabeled samples are close to each other. To learn a domain-invariant representation, it also utilizes a novel alignment loss to ensure that the distance between pairs of class centroids, computed after adding the unlabeled samples, is preserved across different domains. DGSML is trained by a meta learning approach to mimic the distribution shift between the input source domains and unseen target domains. Experimental results on benchmark datasets indicate that DGSML outperforms state-of-the-art domain generalization and semi-supervised learning methods.",,,['no_author_name']

The most common source of data available for this type of analysis is player trajectory tracking data, which encode vital information about the motion, action, and intention of players. At an individual level, each player exhibits a characteristic trajectory style that can distinguish him from other players. At a team level, a set of player trajectories forms unique dynamics that differentiate the team from others.

A wide variety of studies have shown that certain genes are expressed only in specific cell-types. Analysis of cell-type-specific gene expression patterns can provide insights into the relationship between genes, connectivity, brain regions, and cell-types. However, automated methods for identifying cell-type-specific genes are lacking to date. Here, we describe a set of computational methods for identifying cell-type-specific genes in the mouse brain by automated image computing of in situ hybridization (ISH) expression patterns. We applied invariant image feature descriptors to capture local gene expression information from cellular-resolution ISH images. We then built image-level representations by applying vector quantization on the image descriptors. We employed regularized learning methods for classifying genes specifically expressed in different brain cell-types. These methods can also rank image features based on their discriminative power. We used a data set of 2,872 genes from the Allen Brain Atlas in the experiments. Results showed that our methods are predictive of cell-type-specificity of genes. Our classifiers achieved AUC values of approximately 87% when the enrichment level is set to 20. In addition, we showed that the highly-ranked image features captured the relationship between cell-types. Overall, our results showed that automated image computing methods could potentially be used to identify cell-type-specific genes in the mouse brain.",['excluded_keywords'],Rongjian Li,['excluded_tags']

Self-supervised Transformer architectures have shown outstanding performance in a variety of structured tasks in natural language processing and computer vision. However, their use in modelling sparse irregular time series with tabular data has not been widely explored. One of the major challenges is the quadratic scaling of self-attention layers that can significantly limit the input sequence length. In this work, we introduce TESS, Transformers for EHR data with Self Supervised learning, a self-supervised Transformer-based architecture designed to extract robust representations from EHR data. We propose an input binning scheme that aggregates the time series inputs and sparsity information into a regular sequence with fixed length, enabling the training of larger and deeper Transformers. We demonstrate that significant compression of EHR input data is possible without sacrificing useful information, likely due to the highly correlated nature of observations in small time bins. We then introduce self-supervised prediction tasks that provide rich and informative signals for model pre-training.

Although current drugs for treating leishmaniasis exist, these are either highly toxic, ineffective, or expensive. For this reason, there is an urgent need to identify affordable, safer, and more effective treatments. Drug repurposing is a promising method for identifying existing molecules with the potential to treat leishmaniasis. Here, we present a deep learning model for drug repurposing based on hyperbolic graph neural networks. We leverage experimentally validated protein-drug interactions and molecular descriptors across three different parasites to train and validate our model. The final network model shows significant gains over the best baseline model, with an 11.6% increase in precision of the top scoring 0.5% protein-drug pairs. Finally, our model identified two experimental drugs that could target three L. major proteins involved in drug resistance and cell cycle regulation, which play an essential role in ensuring the parasite’s survival inside the host.Author summaryLeishmanisis is a deadly and neglected tropical disease.

Although current drugs for treating leishmaniasis exist, these are either highly toxic, ineffective, or expensive. For this reason, there is an urgent need to identify affordable, safer, and more effective treatments. Drug repurposing is a promising method for identifying existing molecules with the potential to treat leishmaniasis. Here, we present a deep learning model for drug repurposing based on hyperbolic graph neural networks. We leverage experimentally validated protein-drug interactions and molecular descriptors across three different parasites to train and validate our model. The final network model shows significant gains over the best baseline model, with an 11.6% increase in precision of the top scoring 0.5% protein-drug pairs. Finally, our model identified two experimental drugs that could target three L. major proteins involved in drug resistance and cell cycle regulation, which play an essential role in ensuring the parasite’s survival inside the host.Author summaryLeishmanisis is a deadly and neglected tropical disease.

Traditional control variate methods require knowledge of means and focus on per-sample variance reduction. In contrast, PEMC aims at overall cost-aware variance reduction, eliminating the need for mean knowledge. PEMC leverages pre-trained neural architectures to construct effective control variates and replaces computationally expensive sample-path generation with efficient neural network evaluations. This allows PEMC to address scenarios where no good control variates are known.

The key criterion therein is to maximize the mutual information between the data points and their cluster labels. Such an approach, however, does not explicitly promote any type of inter-cluster behavior. We instead propose to maximize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the underlying data distributions associated to clusters (referred to as cluster distributions). We show it to entail the mutual information criterion along with maximizing cross entropy between the cluster distributions. For practical efficiency, we propose to empirically estimate the objective of KL-D between clusters in its dual form leveraging deep neural nets as a dual function approximator. Remarkably, our theoretical analysis establishes that estimating the divergence measure in its dual form simplifies the problem of clustering to one of optimally finding k-1 cut points for k clusters in the 1-D dual functional space. Overall, our approach enables linear-time clustering algorithms with theoretical guarantees of near-optimality, owing to the submodularity of the objective.

Operational system captures the day-to-day operations and BI database refreshes operational data periodically. Methods A component to create the metadata repository which maintains the current BI database summary by logical data partitioning using range based partition for frequently changing parameter which are critical to business. During different time frequency, using metadata repository component identifies the latest data victim between BI vs operational data and refreshes the modified victim to BI database. Findings In traditional data loading approach from Operational system to BI database, huge volume of data gets refreshed periodically irrespective of modifications, which leads to higher processing time and cost. To overcome this limitation, this proposed methodology helps to identify the latest data victims present in operational systems instead of bulk data replacement which can minimize the processing time and enables faster data transformation to achieve “Time to Decision"" and “Quick to Market"" implementation for business enhancements. Also component can be scheduled for data refresh with different time frequency for multiple critical to business as well as frequently changing parameters.

This expectation is built on the assumption that synthesized human-machine systems which bring humans in the loop by allowing them to provide input, oversight, or supervision outperform humans or machines alone and create a whole that is superior to the sum of its parts. Despite the appeal of such an expectation, what we know about the technical and practical requirements of effective ML utilization has not been applied to carefully consider when human-machine systems might deliver on such expectations: i.e., outperform humans or machines alone. In this paper, we showcase the importance of the recognition and quantification of the false alarms in any technically sound and practically interpretable analysis of the effectiveness of ML systems.

At the same time, a lot of this money is lost due to high failure costs. Software testing aims to reduce the waste of resources. GUI testing is a crucial aspect of the overall testing process due to its ability to test end-to-end and the GUI being the user facing component of the software. Traditionally, manual tests and scripted automated tests are used to determine if the GUI meets the requirements. However, both approaches are very costly in terms of both money and time. Scriptless testing attempts to address the costs associated with GUI testing. With a rapidly growing mobile application market, there is an opportunity to apply scriptless testing. However, scriptless testing is not well-established in this area. Therefore, this study presents a tool for scriptless GUI testing in the mobile domain.We present a literature study on the available tools and the failure detection component (oracle) for automated testing. We extract several design aspects important for creating a scriptless GUI testing tool. Additionally, we obtain an overview of testing oracles. Next, we present the mTESTAR tool for scriptless GUI testing in the mobile domain and the implemented oracles. Lastly, we validate mTESTAR on the industrial ING Bankieren application.

Academics have generated a large body of research that addresses part of that challenge–with a particular focus on predicting customer churn. However, several other equally important aspects of managing retention have not received similar level of attention. This suggests a managerial problem not completely solved, and a program of academic research not completely aligned with managerial needs. Therefore, our goal is to draw on previous research and current practice to provide insights on managing retention and identify areas for future research. This examination leads us to advocate a broad perspective on customer retention. We propose a definition that extends the concept beyond the traditional binary retain/not retain view of retention. We discuss a variety of metrics to measure and monitor retention. We present an integrated framework for managing retention that leverages emerging opportunities offered by new data sources and new methodologies such as machine learning. We highlight the importance of distinguishing between which customers are at risk and which should be targeted–as they aren’t necessarily the same customers.

Distributional RL advances this approach by representing reward prediction error (RPE) signals as vectors, capturing a broader range of scenarios [2]. This enhances the agent’s understanding of environmental states and improves learning efficacy.Despite advancements in deep RL, scaling to highdimensional settings remains challenging due to large parameter spaces and extensive training data, increasing computational costs and affecting performance [3]. Quantum RL offers a solution by reducing parameter complexity while maintaining robust performance [4]. Simulations show Quantum RL outperforms classical RL in large search spaces, faster learning, and better exploration-exploitation trade-offs [5].

Interactions in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) include effects of transcription factors, repressors, small metabolites, and microRNA species. In addition, the effects of regulatory interactions are not always simultaneous, but can occur after a finite time delay, or as a combined outcome of simultaneous and time delayed interactions. Powerful biotechnologies have been rapidly and successfully measuring levels of genetic expression to illuminate different states of biological systems. This has led to an ensuing challenge to improve the identification of specific regulatory mechanisms through regulatory network reconstructions. Solutions to this challenge will ultimately help to spur forward efforts based on the usage of regulatory network reconstructions in systems biology applications. We have developed a hierarchical recurrent neural network (HRNN) that identifies time-delayed gene interactions using time-course data. A customized genetic algorithm (GA) was used to optimize hierarchical connectivity of regulatory genes and a target gene. The proposed design provides a non-fully connected network with the flexibility of using recurrent connections inside the network. These features and the non-linearity of the HRNN facilitate the process of identifying temporal patterns of a GRN. Our HRNN method was implemented with the Python language.

Due to their simplicity and success at modelling the monetary economic indicators VARs have become a standard tool for central bankers to construct economic forecasts. In light of the recent advancements in computational power and the development of advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms we propose a simple way to integrate these tools into the VAR framework. This paper aims to contribute to the time series literature by introducing a ground-breaking methodology which we refer to as Deep Vector Autoregression (Deep VAR). By fitting each equation of the VAR system with a deep neural network, the Deep VAR outperforms the VAR in terms of in-sample fit, out-of-sample fit and point forecasting accuracy. In particular, we find that the Deep VAR is able to better capture the structural economic changes during periods of uncertainty and recession.",,,['no_author_name']

Like simpler models, LLMs distill meaningful representations in their latent embeddings that have been shown to correlate with external variables. Nonetheless, the correlation of such representations has often been linked to human-like intelligence in the latter but not the former. We probe models of varying complexity including random projections, matrix decompositions, deep autoencoders and transformers: all of them successfully distill information that can be used to predict latent or external variables and yet none of them have previously been linked to AGI. We argue and empirically demonstrate that the finding of meaningful patterns in latent spaces of models cannot be seen as evidence in favor of AGI. Additionally, we review literature from the social sciences that shows that humans are prone to seek such patterns and anthropomorphize. We conclude that both the methodological setup and common public image of AI are ideal for the misinterpretation that correlations between model representations and some variables of interest are 'caused' by the model's understanding of underlying 'ground truth’ relationships. We, therefore, call for the academic community to exercise extra caution, and to be keenly aware of principles of academic integrity, in interpreting and communicating about AI research outcomes.",,,"['no_publication_date', 'no_author_name']"

ObjectiveThis paper aims to improve the understanding of the current state of practice through a case study of the incident management process on a software-defined company. MethodWe conduct a single-case exploratory case study by interviewing 15 subject matter experts on how tools are used, the challenges experienced and the future opportunities of the process.

Core challenges include monitoring data quality, the complexity of the environment, and the balance between minimising incident resolution time and following procedural guidelines. Future opportunities can lessen these challenges by making better use of available tooling and employing machine learning approaches.

Therefore, banks and financial institutions are required to offer clients increasingly effective and sophisticated services for illegal transaction detection. Machine learning strategies are commonly employed for this crucial application. However, classical models are not satisfactory enough in highly unbalanced classification tasks like fraud detection.Quantum machine learning, working intrinsically in a higher dimensional computation space thanks to superposition and entanglement, can express more complex models than its classical counterpart and thus could provide a significant advantage in identifying potential illegal transactions. This work aims to analyze the potential of quantum classifiers in the fraud detection context, focusing on the Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) model.

So far, Earth observation has been carried out only by satellite images, which are limited in resolution and suffer from important barriers such as cloud occlusion. Microdrone solutions, providing video streaming capabilities, are already available on the marketplace, but they are limited to altitudes of a few hundred feet. In contrast, UAVs equipped with high quality cameras can fly at altitudes of a few thousand feet and can fill the gap between satellite observations and ground sensors. Therefore, new needs for data processing arise, spanning from computer vision algorithms to sensor and mission management. This paper presents a solution for automatically detecting changes in images acquired at different times by patrolling UAVs flying over the same targets (but not necessarily along the same path or at the same altitude). Change detection in multi-temporal images is a prerequisite for land cover inspection, which, in turn, sets up the basis for detecting potentially dangerous or threatening situations.",,Walter Allasia,['no_publication_date']

For example, the pre-trained BERT model can be easily fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create a state-of-the-art model for a wide range of tasks. However, the fine-tuned BERT model suffers considerably at zero-shot when applied to a different domain. In this paper, we present a novel two-step domain adaptation framework based on curriculum learning and domain-discriminative data selection. The domain adaptation is conducted in a mostly unsupervised manner using a small target domain validation set for hyper-parameter tuning. We tested the framework on four large public datasets with different domain similarities and task types. Our framework outperforms a popular discrepancy-based domain adaptation method on most transfer tasks while consuming only a fraction of the training budget.",,Bing Xiang,['no_tags']

The filtering effect of the smoothing splines allows for usage of noisy sensor data and the method is robust to odometry drift.

Link prediction (Zhang & Chen, 2018) in these graphs is an actively studied problem that is critical for many applications. For example, drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction is a task important for drug development and repurposing: on the one hand, some diseases are best treated by combinations of drugs (eg, antiviral drugs are typically administered as cocktails), on the other hand, one has to know about critical side effects between new molecules and existing drugs (in a stricter sense, side effects are consequences of DDIs).Graph neural networks gained great success in such applications recently. However, learning over the entire graphs is often computationally expensive or even impossible due to their sheer size.

Empirically, the local optima of these loss functions can be connected by a simple curve in model space, along which the loss remains fairly constant. Yet, current path finding algorithms do not consider the influence of symmetry in the loss surface caused by weight permutations of the networks corresponding to the minima. We propose a framework to investigate the effect of symmetry on the landscape connectivity by directly optimizing the weight permutations of the networks being connected. Through utilizing an existing neuron alignment technique, we derive an initialization for the weight permutations. Empirically, this initialization is critical for efficiently learning a simple, planar, low-loss curve between networks that successfully generalizes. Additionally, we introduce a proximal alternating minimization scheme to address if an optimal permutation can be learned, with some provable convergence guarantees. We find that the learned parameterized curve is still a low-loss curve after permuting the weights of the endpoint models, for a subset of permutations. We also show that there is small but steady performance gain in performance of the ensembles constructed from the learned curve, when considering weight space symmetry.",,Igor Melnyk,['no_publication_date']

In particular, this example also shows that as opposed to the claim from (Saxe et al., 2018), non-saturating nonlinearities can achieve compression. Consider the non-saturating Leaky-ReLU nonlinearity R (x) max (x, x/10). Let X= X0∪ X1/4, with X0={1, 2, 3, 4} and X1/4={5, 6, 7, 8}, and labels 0 and 1/4, respectively.

Figs. 9 (b) show the Gaussian motion at the output of the first layer and the resulting clustering. For the second layer (Fig. 9 (c)), the clustered bundle X1/4 is gradually raised by growing b2, such that its elements successively split as they cross the origin; further tightening of the bundle is due to shrinking| w2|. Fig. 9 (d) shows the mutual information of the first (blue) and second (red) layers. The merging of the elements in X1/4 after their initial divergence is clearly reflected in the mutual information.

Identification of such genes can be useful in the process of constructing gene regulatory networks. Furthermore, analysis of the intergenic regions corresponding to bidirectional genes can help identify regulatory elements, such as transcription factor binding sites.Wang et al.[6] have identified 2471 bidirectional gene pairs in Arabidopsis thaliana and found that the corresponding intergenic regions are rich in regulatory elements that are essential for the initiation of transcription.

In fact, training these methods on a combination of several domains often degrades the quality of learned representations compared to the models trained on a single domain. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Domain Self-Supervised Learning (MDSSL) approach that can effectively perform representation learning on multiple, diverse datasets. In MDSSL, we propose a three-level hierarchical loss for measuring the agreement between augmented views of a given sample, agreement between samples within a dataset and agreement between samples across datasets.

Moreover, MDSSL encoders can generalize more effectively to unseen datasets compared to both single-domain and multi-domain baselines. MDSSL is also highly efficient in terms of the resource usage as it stores and trains a single model for multiple datasets leading up to  reduction in training time.

Researchers use clustering algorithms to group individual cells into populations that can be evaluated across different levels of disease progression, drug response, and other clinical statuses. In many cases, multiple sets of clusters must be generated to assess varying levels of cluster specificity. For example, there are many subtypes of leukocytes (e.g. T cells), whose individual preponderance and phenotype must be assessed for statistical/functional significance. In this report, we introduce a novel hierarchical density clustering algorithm (HAL-x) that uses supervised linkage methods to build a cluster hierarchy on raw single-cell data. With this new approach, HAL-x can quickly predict multiple sets of labels for immense datasets, achieving a considerable improvement in computational efficiency on large datasets compared to existing methods. We also show that cell clusters generated by HAL-x yield near-perfect F1-scores when classifying different clinical statuses based on single-cell profiles. Our hierarchical density clustering algorithm achieves high accuracy in single cell classification in a scalable, tunable and rapid manner.

To address these challenges, we define table similarity in the context of data transformation activities within data-driven enterprises, considering the specific business needs related to data similarity.

Building systems, of which HVAC is one, rarely perform as well in practice as anticipated during design due to improper equipment selection or installation, lack of commissioning, or improper maintenance. AHU operations are typically supervised and maintained by either an onsite facilities team or an offsite third party contractor. The number of AHU’s in a typical large commercial or manufacturing site HVAC system often outnumbers those supervising and maintaining the system by 20 to 1. This means that routine mechanical maintenance is typically carried out only when necessary due to an end user complaint, a machine breakdown or a breached alarm limit.

However, it is also reasonable to assume that an AV that reaches its functional limit may crash into an obstacle without releasing a take–over request at all (silent failures). To enhance the take–over performance in such a silent–failure situation, especially when the driver has been monitoring the AV, we developed a design concept that presents the AV’s planned trajectory on the windshield. We hypothesized that the planned trajectory would allow the human driver to predict a potential crash in advance and therefore enhance the driver’s take–over performance even when the AV does not release a take–over request before the crash. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a driving–simulator experiment where participants monitored the driving status of an AV with or without the planned trajectory in the context of silent failures. The results showed that, when the planned trajectory was projected on the windshield as if it were an augmented–reality display, the crash rate decreased by 13.3%, and the take–over response time decreased by 825 ms compared to when the planned trajectory was not provided.

Annotation is a very expensive process for industry.

In order to reduce costs, different schemes can be put in practice, eg self-supervision and semi-supervision methods.

In response to these challenges, we propose ual dvancement of epresentation earning and lustering ($\textit{\textbf{DARLC}}$), an innovative framework that leverages contrastive learning to enhance the representations derived from masked image modeling. Simultaneously,  integrates cluster assignments in a cohesive, end-to-end approach. This integrated clustering strategy addresses the ``class collision problem'' inherent in contrastive learning, thus improving the quality of the resulting representations. To generate more plausible positive views for contrastive learning, we employ a graph attention network-based technique that produces denoised images as augmented data. As such, our framework offers a comprehensive approach that improves the learning of representations by enhancing their local perceptibility, distinctiveness, and the understanding of relational semantics. Furthermore, we utilize a Student's t mixture model to achieve more robust and adaptable clustering of SNIs.

Traditional methods for developing and scoring measurement instruments require large sets of human responses, making them time-consuming and costly. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer new ways to tackle these challenges. In this brief note, we explore the use of convex hulls—a concept from computational geometry—in combination with AI-driven large language models to enhance psychometric practice. A convex hull is the smallest convex “boundary” around a set of points. By treating language embeddings as high-dimensional coordinates and forming convex hulls, we can interpret the structure of items and free text responses in new ways. We propose two novel applications of convex hulls:(1) item analysis without data: We use convex hulls to check if a test item “belongs” to a scale, providing a new indicator of item quality; and (2) scoring free text: By interpreting candidate responses in relation to the convex hull of other responses, we propose an objective way to score psychological constructs from natural language. Each method is possible in supervised and unsupervised modes. These methods are experimental and yet to be validated. We outline, but do not implement, brief methods for testing their efficacy. We discuss open questions that we expect will impact the utility of these methods, such as, a) why we don’t just ask the LLM to score the items and responses, b) why convex hull centroids might be preferred over clustering and scale embedding means c) what to do if the construct hull does not match the intended target, and d) whether the …",,Damiano D'Urso,['no_publication_date']

Programming languages with strong static type systems assist programmers by capturing and checking the fundamental structure of programs in a very intuitive way. Given this success, it is natural to ask: can we capture and check more of the structure of programs?In this work I consider a new approach called refinement-type checking that allows many common program properties to be captured and checked. This approach builds on the strength of the type system of a language by adding the ability to specify refinements of each type. Such refinement types have been considered previously, and following previous work I focus on refinements that include subtyping and a form of intersection types. Central to my approach is the use of a bidirectional checking algorithm. This does not attempt to infer refinements for some expressions, such as functions, but only checks them against refinements. This avoids some difficulties encountered in previous work, and requires that the programmer annotate their program with some of the intended refinements, but the required annotations appear to be very reasonable. Further, they document properties in a way that is natural, precise, easy to read, and reliable. I demonstrate the practicality of my approach by showing that it can be used to design a refinement-type checker for a widely-used language with a strong type system: Standard ML. This requires two main technical developments. Firstly, I present a new variant of intersection types that achieve soundness in the presence of call-by-value effects by incorporating a value restriction.

In this simulated environment, our results show these personas produced meaningful behavioural differences in all assessed categories, with these behaviours generally being consistent with expectations derived from human research.

The genre can be characterized by recourse to a limited number of types of plot, although there are distinct sub-categories. Most importantly, the genre is available as an ebook, so each novel in the imprint has a definitive edition that is easily subjected to machine analysis.

In this study, we investigated whether an LLM persona with a specific Big Five personality profile would perform an investment task similarly to a human with the same personality traits. We used a simulated investment task to determine if these results could be generalised into actual behaviours. In this simulated environment, our results show these personas produced meaningful behavioural differences in all assessed categories, with these behaviours generally being consistent with expectations derived from human research. We found that LLMs are able to generalise traits into expected behaviours in three areas: learning style, impulsivity and risk appetite while environmental attitudes could not be accurately represented. In addition, we showed that LLMs produce behaviour that is more reflective of human behaviour in a simulation environment compared to a survey environment.",,Anna Leontjeva,['no_publication_date']

To efficiently support such video transmissions, a multi-view video plus depth coding architecture has recently been introduced using depth maps. Depth maps have distinct spatial and temporal characteristics and existing coding techniques are unable to exploit these characteristics fully in coding, which also affects the image quality of depth-image-based rendering. This thesis aims at designing an independent and autonomous depth map coder capable of exploiting unique depth characteristics to achieve high compression efficiency with better depth quality.",,Shampa Shahriyar,['no_publication_date']

It's great to be in Geelong. It's been a big week for the Bank in Victoria, with the Board meeting in Melbourne on Tuesday and the Governor's speech that evening. I don't plan to repeat what he said or speak in detail about the Board's decision. Rather, I'd like to take a step back and talk about some aspects of how the Bank's economics team understand and interpret economic developments, so we can do the analysis that is an important input into the Board's decisions.Most of our job is interpreting recent data and using that to forecast the future. We lean heavily on our intellectual frameworks in economics for thinking about how economies work. But we also need to account for an array of special factors and big-picture trends that don't sit neatly in top-down, whole-economy models, such as standard economic forecasting models. So today I'd like to talk about how we handle special factors in our understanding of the economy. I'll also give some examples of the kinds of factors that have been relevant of late.",,Luci Ellis,['no_publication_date']
